# Best Movie Recommender
![Image](/static/bmr_logo.jpg?raw=true)

Best Movie Recommender chooses five films for you based on your previous choice.

It uses a cosine similarity matrix generated from the small MovieLens dataset (100K entries).

JSON-based incremental autocomplete inspired by https://github.com/abdulbaqi/flaskajax/.

This is a work in progress created as a part of my data science/machine learning studies at SPICED Academy Berlin (@spicedacademy).
